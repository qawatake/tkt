The core workflow is simple:

2. **edit** - Modify tickets locally using any text editor
3. **push** - Sync changes back to JIRA

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/qawatake/tkt/cmd/tkt@latest
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up JIRA API Token

First, create a JIRA API token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 2. Initialize Configuration

```bash
tkt init
```

This creates a `tkt.yml` configuration file in your current directory with your JIRA server details and authentication.

### 3. Pull Tickets

```bash
tkt pull
```

Downloads JIRA tickets as Markdown files to `./tmp/` (configurable).

### 4. Edit Locally

Open and edit the Markdown files in your preferred editor. Each ticket includes:

```markdown
---
key: PRJ-123
status: In Progress
assignee: qawatake@example.com
summary: Fix authentication bug
---

# PRJ-123: Fix authentication bug

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

```

Syncs your local changes back to JIRA.
